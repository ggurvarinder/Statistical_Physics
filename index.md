# ENSEMBLES

Ensembles is a collection of identical systems.

## TYPES OF ENSEMBLES

1. **Microcanonical Ensemble** : It is a collection of identical isolated systems, that is, no exchange of matter and energy between system and sorrounding. The walls of the system are insulated, non-movable and impermeable. In this ensemble Energy (**E**), Volume (**V**) and Number of particles (**N**) are characteristic parameters.

2. **Canonical Ensemble** : It is a collection of identical closed systems, that is, there is no exchange of matter between system and sorrounding but energy can be exchanged between the two. The walls of the system are conducting, non-movable and impermeable. In this ensemble Temperature (**T**), Volume (**V**) and Number of particles (**N**) are characteristic parameters.  

3. **Grand Canonical Ensemble** : It is a collection of identical open systems, that is, there is exchange of both matter and energy between system and sorrounding. The walls of the system are conducting, non-movable and impermeable. In this ensemble Temperature (**T**), Volume (**V**) and Number of particles (**N**) are characteristic parameters.
